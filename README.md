<h2> Description </h2>
This web application is my first full stack project. It is a simple application that allows users to keep track of their scores in the game Magic: The Gathering. 
I made this project for personal use, as I play this game with my friends, and we always have to keep track of our scores.
Some features of this application are: Saving the scores, viewing the scores and calculating winrates for both players and their decks.
Commander scoreboard allows users to easily see their best decks and their winrates with them.
Users can also see their personal match history and the winrates of their opponents.
